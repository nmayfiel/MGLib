# MGLib
A Miniature Graphics Library

## Getting Started
### Macos
```
cd /path/to/mg/lib && make
```

## Description
At it's core, MGLib is a platform layer. It interfaces with the underlying platform and exposes useful functions for drawing. It is intended to lower the bar of entry for learning graphics code.

## Future Plans
* Documentation
* Adding OpenGL implementation on Windows
* Adding DirectX 11 on Windows
* Ability to use custom shaders
